Incorporated in 2019 by Tom Korach, a Medical Doctor and Data Scientist; Jeff To, Master of Science in Engineering who also serviced the insurance industry while working for 5 years at Salesforce, as the CEO he’s driving the connections and expansions; Valerio Zhang, Senior engineer, cybersecurity, enterprise systems design, is the technical personal in this group. 

How the idea for this company came about is ambiguous, there was a statement on Jeff To’s linkedin page: <em>“co-design partnership at the start of 2020, resulted in a solution that is already delivering tangible business value.”</em> it appears to be that the CEO, Jeff To was servicing insurance companies while working at Salesforce and came up with the idea there. The company has received seed money funding through Plug and Play Insurtech and is partnering with Root Insurance Company to <em>“maximize recovery of subrogation opportunities within the company’s claims portfolio”.</em> Root Insurance is an insurance carrier powered by mobile, their mini bio also states they don’t use demographics to give rates, only driving behavior. 


## Business Activities:

#### What specific financial problem is the company or project trying to solve?
Improving the pipeline of recovering money lost to claims: “subrogation & recovery platform”

#### Who is the company's intended customer?  Is there any information about the market size of this set of customers?
Claims processors, carriers and policy holders. Medium to large size insurance companies. 

#### What solution does this company offer that their competitors do not or cannot offer? (What is the unfair advantage they utilize?)
They use NLP and machine learning for subrogation, they’re also pre-integrated with Guidewire and Duck Creek. 

#### Which technologies are they currently using, and how are they implementing them?
NLP, AI, Predictive analytics, Python, postgresql, airflow, AWS

## Landscape:

#### What have been the major trends and innovations of this domain over the last 5-10 years?
Focus on the customer, i.e consumer satisfaction. There is a lot of competition in the insurance space, so to keep current customers, more focus should be placed on customer experience. One way companies are looking to do this is through claims settlement. Faster settlements keep the customer engaged and satisfied with the process. There’s also a greater focus on investing in “customer facing digital platforms, intelligent automation to streamline processes, and develop smart contracts for claims and predictive underwriting” (KPMG, p.8) 

#### What are the other major companies in this domain?
Majesco, friss.com, snapsheet, Groundspeed

## Results

#### What has been the business impact of this company so far?
They won a competition by Zurich insurance and Accenture. It’s hard to know the business impact because the company is so new (founded 2019), but it seems claims processing is an area that insurance companies are looking to save costs. 

#### What are some of the core metrics that companies in this domain use to measure success? How is your company performing, based on these metrics?
The big promise of this company is to save insurance companies money from claims processing and improve loss ratios. They look at laws, input data from local news sources, or past claims to make decisions on the claims that have been submitted. It looks like for this company the end goal is to help insurance companies save money. 

#### How is your company performing relative to competitors in the same domain?
It is really hard to determine financially how they are performing, but as far as marketing they seem to be doing well. They are giving talks at conferences, winning startup competitions, growing their social media presence, having partnerships with leading industry software companies (Guidewire/DuckCreek), and partnering with other insurtech firms (Root Inc.), so they are aggressive and competitive. 

## Recommendations

#### If you were to advise the company, what products or services would you suggest they offer? (This could be something that a competitor offers, or use your imagination!)
They could focus on the customer experience as part of their package, though that is what they tout in some of their marketing material, it seems they are focused directly on the claims processor/insurance provider. Perhaps, they could look into ways to measure customer experience through the claims processing experience. 

#### Why do you think that offering this product or service would benefit the company?
The customer experience is what will help set up a competitive advantage for their main customers (insurance companies), so integrating that now will be useful in the long run.  

#### What technologies would this additional product or service utilize?
Maybe surveys to ask the people filing claims about their experience, NLP, social media tags. 

#### Why are these technologies appropriate for your solution?
They make measuring customer satisfaction quantifiable, which helps determine what actions to take to improve.
